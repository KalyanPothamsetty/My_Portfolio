                Differently disabled people face many hardships in life, having to be dependent on a third person to move from place to place.
                The electric wheelchair is an implementation and experimental platform of a low-cost intelligent wheelchair for the disabled.
                To provide them with a supporting aid, many scientists have been toiling for a long time. The invention of wheel chair is a great boon to them but it still restricts their motion.
                This project aims at providing them with a non-polluting and cost effective solution in the form of an Electric Wheel Chair.</dd><br>
